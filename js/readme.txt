JAVASCRIPT FOR THE WEBSITE

  1. For conditioning in the contact forn. If one of the input column is empty, trigger the error message in the Bootstrap's modal
  2. For manipulating the navigation bar. The navbar doesn't have background by default, but if it's scrolled, it triggers the background. Lower media breakpoint added the background permanently (need to refresh from responsive view)
